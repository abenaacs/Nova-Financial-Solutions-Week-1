1. **run_analysis.py**: The main script to execute the end-to-end analysis.
2. **analysis.py**: Contains functions for EDA, sentiment analysis, and correlation computation.

## CI/CD Integration

The project includes a CI/CD pipeline to ensure code reliability and maintainability:

- **GitHub Actions Workflow**:
  - Located in `.github/workflows/unittests.yml`.
  - Automatically runs unit tests on each push or pull request.
  - Ensures continuous integration by verifying that new code doesnâ€™t break existing functionality.
